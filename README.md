CMPSC442-AI: Spring 2021. Taylan Unal
This course provides an overview of the foundations, problems, approaches, implementation, and applications of, artificial intelligence. Topics covered include problem solving, goal-based and adversarial search, logical, probabilistic, and decision theoretic knowledge representation and inference, decision making, and learning. Through programming assignments that sample these topics, students acquire an understanding of what it means to build rational agents of different sorts as well as applications of AI techniques in language processing, planning, vision.
